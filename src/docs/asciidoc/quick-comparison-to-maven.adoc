== Quick comparison to Maven

* Maven module -> Gradle project
* convention over configuration
** Maven hard-codes some conventions (e.g. production and test code)
** in Gradle, conventions are coming from plugins. For example, you can have a custom integrationTest, in addition to "main" and "production", whereas in Maven you would need to create an additional module for the integration tests
** this is part of Gradle's philosophy: we like conventions, but they should come from plugins
*** note that puting a lot of logic in the build scripts (e.g. custom tasks) goes against Gradle's philosophy: such logic should be put in custom plugins instead, to keep builds declarative
